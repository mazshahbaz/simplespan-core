# SimpleSpan Executive Summary

**Purpose**  
A governed AI framework for structural engineering software development. It standardizes collaboration between engineers and AI under verifiable rules.

**Core Idea**  
AI agents—Planner, Implementer, Reviewer, Auditor—operate under an AI Coordinator (AIC). Each acts within schema-defined limits, ensuring CHBDC/SI compliance and traceability.

**Framework Layers**  
- Governance: Schemas, validation, CCPs  
- AIC Orchestration: Intent routing and compliance  
- Agents: Role-based AI execution  
- Domains: Modular structural logic (Sections, FEA)  
- Execution: CI, validation, dashboards

**Advantages**  
- Automates software generation under standards  
- Logs all work for transparency and reproducibility  
- Adapts to new codes or modules quickly

**Roadmap**  
1. Governance baseline (complete)  
2. Section Properties domain  
3. FEA and moving loads  
4. Metrics dashboard  
5. AI improvement and expansion

**Vision**  
SimpleSpan is a living engineering system where AI develops, validates, and improves software under human governance.
